  <p>
This photography project takes inspiration from the Album “How Will You Know if You Never Try” by Coin, specifically the song “Talk too Much”. This song contains a very upbeat sound and is continued throughout the album. It always reminded me of Summer and part of my childhood summers were spent exploring different candy shops. The album cover was taken on a Digital Sony Camera and edited in Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom to create a panoramic wrapping album cover with the same figure peering at the shelves. Three photos were taken to get the final photos and were then overlaid and the figures cut out and layered to create the wrapping look of the cover. The lighting was then brightened and made warmer to create a buzz on the light emitted from the colorful sodas and to convey a tone of nostalgia and warmth. This was the first step into the collaboration of physical to digital art that I took. Created in 2022, the piece displays the use of editing software to alter the look of the images. </p>
