  <h1>Luminecence Peaks Through</h1>
   <img src="../assets/final light.png" alt="Jellyfish Light Preview" class="project-image" />
  <p>
“Luminecence Peaks Through” created through the use of Blender in 2024, a 3D graphics building software, incorporates aspects of marine life, specifically the flowing, drape of Jellyfish tentacles and the bioluminescence of numerous marine organisms. This light installation contains orbs of light hidden within twisting sheets of metal, built within Blender. Bioluminescence is the process of organisms to produce light through chemical reactions within the body and is used to attract mates or prey or to fight off predators. Part of what creates an interest in the patterns of light that jellyfish emit is the diversity in patterns and additionally the way shadows play a role in their appearance. When light is covered or hidden in shadows, a different tone/feeling is evoked and especially when movement of the tentacles is involved. This was conveyed in the piece as different bulbs are seen at different angles/point of views and additionally differing colors are depicted. If built/printed, the bulbs of the light could be made of LEDs that allow for the color to be controlled and changed to depict diversity of colors. In this project, an initial sculpture of a jellyfish was created based on the inspiration of the Sea Nettle Jellyfish from the Monterey Aquarium. The materials of the tentacles and the bell were then experimented with to create a transparent/illuminated look. This was translated into a functional light structure with three bulbs of differing colors and shadows depicted.</p>
